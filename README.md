# Welcome! 👋

Welcome to the pocket note project. This is a personal app I am using to help my self montly. It is a kind of a expenses app, but this app was made specially for me.

I live in a ranch with other families, we  split the value of our Power bills, sometimes this is hard to manage because we have some values to consider comparing the previous month. The idea of the app is to help specially in this scenario.

In the future I intend to extend the features to help my self in other tasks such as: manage the food of my guinea pigs, pay monthly bills.

## How to run the project? 📦

```dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs```

We need to generated code because we are using the libraries that requires this, this libraries are: Injectable, Mobx, and Autoroute.
